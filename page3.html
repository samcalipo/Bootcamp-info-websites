                    <p>
                        After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer 
                        Career Path, I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to
                        get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet
                        like-minded peers.

                <p class="boldText bigerFont">How I stay committed to learning</p>
                <p>
                    I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to 
                    spend hours learning, then try to create simple projects using 
                    what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share
                    what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.
                </p>
                <p class="boldText">How I got started</p>
                <p>
                    I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I 
                    would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, 
                    I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short
                    summaries of what I learned using my own words.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That helped me grow what I was learning, and I realized that posting my 
                    learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
